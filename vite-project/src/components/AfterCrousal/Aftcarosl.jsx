                    The agriculture sector, currently valued at US$ 370 billion, is one of the major sectors in the Indian economy. According to the Economic Survey 2020-21, GDP contribution by the agriculture sector is likely to be 19.9% in 2020-21, increasing from 17.8% recorded in 2019-20. Over the years, the government has taken major steps to aid and enhance the agriculture sector with proven farming technologies and supportive policies. The recent evolution of digital technology in farming will further accelerate growth by ensuring higher crop yields and enhance sustainability by reducing water consumption and the use of agrochemicals.

                    Digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence  (AI) and machine learning (ML), remote sensing, big data, block chain and IoT, are transforming agricultural value chains and modernizing operations. While several countries, such as the Netherlands, the US, Australia and Israel, have successfully adopted and exploited digital solutions to revolutionise agriculture, their adoption in India is still in its infancy. The future adoption of digital agriculture in India is anticipated to nurture under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode.
